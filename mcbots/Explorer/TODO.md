# Current Goal
Find diamonds by mining down to y=-59 and branch mining

# Plan
- [ ] Equip iron pickaxe
- [ ] Dig staircase down from y=46 to y=-59 (diamond level)
- [ ] Place torches every 10-15 blocks while descending
- [ ] At y=-59, begin branch mining (2-high tunnels)
- [ ] Mine any diamond ore found with iron pickaxe
- [ ] Collect diamond drops

# Progress
- Starting at y=46 in dripstone_caves
- Have iron pickaxe, 16 torches, 9 coal + 12 sticks for more torches
- No diamonds visible at current depth (survey radius 32)
- Need to descend ~105 blocks to reach y=-59
